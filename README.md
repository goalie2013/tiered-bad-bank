# Project Title: Tiered Bad Bank

### Description/Motivation
I created this project as a learning experience for understanding how to create a full-stack application.

### Installation Guidelines
If you would like to use my project, use git clone.... Run the server in server/index.js (use node server/index.js), and run the client-side in the client/ directory (use npm start).

### Technology used
I used React on the front-end with React-Bootstrap for styling, Node/Express for the server-side code and middleware, with a MongoDB data store. My database is run in a Docker container. I also used the Fetch API to make calls from React to the server side.
For build simplifiction I used Create React App to get started.

### Features
A pretty extensive form validation
